# sexism-on-the-silver-screen
 Final Project for 21H.S05

 In this project, we scraped Wikipedia for data on its actors, divided into categories of male and female. Using the text of the Wikipedia entries, we conducted comparative sentiment analysis, topic modelling and other NLP-based analysis to understand how representations of male and female entertainment figures are different in general public writing.
